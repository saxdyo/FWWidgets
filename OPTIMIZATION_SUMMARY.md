## üîß Usage

All optimizations are integrated into the existing TMDB crawler and can be enabled/disabled:

```python
# Enable all optimizations (default)
client = TMDBClient(enable_optimizations=True)

# Use basic functionality only
client = TMDBClient(enable_optimizations=False)
```

The system gracefully falls back to basic functionality when optimization dependencies are not available, ensuring compatibility and reliability.

## üìù Conclusion

The implementation successfully incorporates all major optimization patterns from `fw2.js`, resulting in a highly optimized, self-healing, and performant TMDB crawler system. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization while maintaining backward compatibility.

The optimization features provide significant performance improvements, better content quality, and enhanced reliability, making the TMDB crawler production-ready for high-volume usage scenarios.

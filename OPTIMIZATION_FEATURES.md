# TMDB Movie Crawler - Advanced Optimization Features

This document describes the advanced optimization features integrated into the TMDB movie crawler, inspired by the optimization patterns from fw2.js.

## Overview

The crawler has been enhanced with sophisticated optimization features that dramatically improve performance, reliability, and user experience. These optimizations are based on real-world patterns from production web applications.

## Core Optimization Modules

### 1. Advanced Caching System (`optimized_cache.py`)

**Inspired by fw2.js OptimizedLRUCache**

- **LRU Cache with TTL**: Intelligent cache eviction based on least-recently-used algorithm with time-to-live expiration
- **Specialized Cache Instances**: 
  - Trending content cache (1 hour TTL)
  - Genres cache (24 hours TTL) 
  - Images cache (2 hours TTL)
  - General API responses cache (30 minutes TTL)
- **Statistics Tracking**: Hit/miss rates, eviction counts, memory utilization
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent access protection with automatic cleanup

**Key Features:**
```python
# Decorator-based caching
@cached('trending', ttl=3600)
def get_trending_data():
    # Function automatically cached
    pass

# Manual cache operations
cache = get_cache('images')
cache.set('key', data, ttl=7200)
result = cache.get('key')
```

### 2. Concurrency Control (`concurrency_control.py`)

**Inspired by fw2.js OptimizedPromisePool**

- **Promise Pool**: Controls concurrent operations with configurable limits
- **Priority-Based Execution**: High/medium/low priority task queues
- **Adaptive Concurrency**: Automatically adjusts based on performance metrics
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request throttling with exponential backoff
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks execution times, queue utilization, success rates

**Key Features:**
```python
# Concurrent processing with priorities
pool = get_pool()
future = pool.submit(download_image, url, priority=TaskPriority.HIGH)

# Batch operations
results = concurrent_map(process_function, items, max_workers=5)

# Adaptive rate limiting
api_rate_limiter.acquire()  # Intelligent delay
api_rate_limiter.smart_delay(response_time, error_occurred=False)
```

### 3. Network Resilience (`network_resilience.py`)

**Inspired by fw2.js CDN Selection and Network Optimization**

- **Intelligent CDN Selection**: Automatic failover between multiple CDN sources
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time CDN performance tracking and scoring
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter and source rotation
- **Geographic Optimization**: China-specific CDN sources and optimizations
- **Request Optimization**: Connection pooling, smart headers, timeout management

**Key Features:**
```python
# Smart request with automatic failover
response = smart_request('GET', url, prefer_china=True)

# Optimized image URLs with best CDN
image_url = get_optimized_image_url(image_path, size='medium')

# Health monitoring
health_report = get_network_health_report()
```

### 4. Enhanced Image Processing (`enhanced_image_optimizer.py`)

**Inspired by fw2.js Image Optimization and Title Overlays**

- **Dynamic Image Sizing**: Content-aware resizing with aspect ratio preservation
- **Advanced Compression**: Quality optimization with progressive JPEG support
- **Title Overlays**: Generate movie backdrops with titles, ratings, and metadata
- **Format Optimization**: Automatic format selection and compression tuning
- **Deduplication**: Hash-based image duplicate detection

**Key Features:**
```python
# Optimize images with custom settings
optimized_data, metadata = optimize_image(
    image_data, 
    ImageProcessingOptions(quality='high', target_width=1920)
)

# Create title backdrops
backdrop_data = create_title_backdrop(
    backdrop_path='/backdrop.jpg',
    title='Movie Title',
    rating=8.5,
    year='2024'
)
```

### 5. Content Filtering (`content_filter.py`)

**Inspired by fw2.js Content Filtering Logic**

- **Quality Thresholds**: Minimum vote counts and ratings
- **Genre Filtering**: Exclude unwanted content types (talk shows, reality TV)
- **Keyword Filtering**: Pattern-based content exclusion
- **Duration Filtering**: Remove short-form content
- **Content Enhancement**: Add metadata, quality scores, and recommendations
- **Internationalization**: Prioritize Chinese titles and descriptions

**Key Features:**
```python
# Filter content with advanced criteria
filtered_movies = filter_content(raw_movie_list)

# Get trending content with smart filtering
trending = get_trending_content(movies, limit=20)

# Content classification and scoring
content_item.quality_score = 85.3
content_item.content_classification = 'feature_movie'
```

### 6. Data Health Monitoring (`data_health_monitor.py`)

**Inspired by fw2.js Data Health Checks and Recovery**

- **Integrity Verification**: Automatic detection of corrupted or missing data
- **Health Scoring**: Comprehensive system health assessment
- **Auto-Recovery**: Intelligent recovery actions for common issues
- **Backup Management**: Automated backup creation and rotation
- **Performance Monitoring**: System resource and performance tracking
- **Anomaly Detection**: Early warning for potential issues

**Key Features:**
```python
# Comprehensive health check
health_results = perform_health_check(full_check=True)

# Get detailed health report
report = get_health_report()
print(f"System health score: {report.health_score}/100")

# Automatic backup and recovery
backup_created = create_backup()
recovery_successful = auto_recovery()
```

        movie['title'],
        rating=movie['vote_average'],
        year=movie['release_date'][:4]
    )
```

### Advanced Optimization Usage

```python
from optimized_cache import get_cache
from concurrency_control import get_pool, TaskPriority
from data_health_monitor import perform_health_check

# Use advanced caching
cache = get_cache('images')
cache.set('processed_image', image_data, ttl=7200)

# Concurrent processing with priorities
pool = get_pool()
futures = []
for item in high_priority_items:
    future = pool.submit(process_item, item, priority=TaskPriority.HIGH)
    futures.append(future)

# Monitor system health
health_results = perform_health_check(full_check=True)
for result in health_results:
    if result.status == 'critical':
        print(f"Critical issue: {result.message}")
```

## Configuration Options

### Cache Configuration

```python

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Performance Metrics

```python
# Get comprehensive statistics
client_stats = tmdb_client.get_stats()
cache_stats = get_cache('api').stats()
health_report = get_health_report()

print(f"Cache hit rate: {cache_stats['hit_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Average response time: {client_stats['request_stats']['average_response_time']:.2f}s")
print(f"System health score: {health_report.health_score}/100")
```

### Debug Information

```python
# Network health
network_health = get_network_health_report()
for source, health in network_health['cdn_health'].items():
    print(f"CDN {source}: {health['health_score']:.2f} (response: {health['response_time']:.2f}s)")

# Content filtering stats
filter_stats = get_content_filter_stats()
print(f"Filter rate: {filter_stats['filter_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Top filtered genres: {filter_stats['top_filtered_genres']}")
```

## Migration Guide

### From Basic to Optimized

1. **Update Dependencies**: Install new requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Configuration**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure settings
3. **Code Changes**: Minimal changes required - optimization is largely transparent
4. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust configuration based on your specific needs

### Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality remains unchanged. New features are opt-in and can be enabled gradually:

- Caching is automatic but can be disabled
- Content filtering can be bypassed
- Concurrent processing falls back to sequential if needed
- Health monitoring is passive and non-intrusive

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Usage**: Adjust cache sizes in configuration
2. **Network Timeouts**: Increase timeout values or reduce concurrency
3. **Image Processing Errors**: Check PIL/Pillow installation and font availability
4. **Cache Misses**: Verify TTL settings and cache key consistency

### Performance Tuning

1. **Cache Optimization**: Monitor hit rates and adjust TTL values
2. **Concurrency Tuning**: Start with lower concurrency and increase gradually
3. **Network Optimization**: Test different CDN sources for your region
4. **Content Filtering**: Adjust filtering criteria based on your requirements

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Intelligent content recommendations
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live performance dashboards
- **Geographic Optimization**: Region-specific optimizations
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Performance comparison tools
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on load
